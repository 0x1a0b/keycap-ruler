# How does it Work?

# Why using this?
If you're in the mech keyboard hobby (addiction? Drug? WHAT NANI?!), you've sometimes struggled to find a way to check the size of your keycaps. 2.25U or 2.5U?! Y U DO DIZ?! So instead of comparing key between themselves (if you have reference keys), here is a chart of keys.

# How could i be sure it's the good size for my screen?
You can see there is a referal image of a credit card. Credit cards are normalized with the rule [ISO 7810 ID-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810). So the chart presented here is done in referal of this. If you don't have a credit card: Rob the bank or stole you mum's one.

# My credit card doesn't fit, DIZ IZ BROKEN!
No. All screen does not have the same DPI and pixel size. That's why there is a Zoom slider which gives you the possibility to adjust the chart to your screen.
